[Convolutional Neural Net to classify dog vs. cat pics] (https://www.kaggle.com/stevenhurwitt/cats-vs-dogs-using-a-keras-convnet)

Basic Convolutional Neural Network (Convnet) implemented in Keras to classify pictures of kitties & puppies :) 

Inspiration for this notebook comes from this [Keras blog post](https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html) 
and the [VGG ConvNet paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf), 
code shamefully stolen from [Jeff Delaney](https://www.kaggle.com/jeffd23).
